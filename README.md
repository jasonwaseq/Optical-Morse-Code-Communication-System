# Optical Morse Code Communication System

In this lab, I implemented a complete optical communication system using a Raspberry Pi 4 as a transmitter and an ESP32 as a receiver. I first configured the Raspberry Pi to transmit messages via an LED by encoding text input from the command line into Morse code, controlling the LED output through GPIO with proper current-limiting resistors. I then set up the ESP32 to receive the Morse light signals using a photodiode sensor connected to its ADC, decoding the optical pulses back into readable text displayed on the console. Finally, I optimized the system’s performance by experimenting with higher transmission speeds, adjusting ADC sampling parameters and testing different GPIO modes to determine the maximum reliable data rate before transmission errors occurred. This project demonstrated my proficiency in embedded systems communication, signal processing, and hardware interfacing between microcontrollers.
